### stability of negative charge 


when we consider oxygen and Sulphur with negative charge sulphur will be weaker base and more stable than oxygen


atoms that is bigger that can stabilize better

consider the oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom. oxygen atom is more electronegative than nitrogen atom and the size difference is not that much oxygen atom is more stable is a weak base
