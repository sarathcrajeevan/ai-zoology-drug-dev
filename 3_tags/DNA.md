DNA is made up of of [[nucleotide]]s, it consist of sugar of a specific arrangement of 35 [[covalent]]ly linked atoms forming a sugar phosphate groups or base attached to it. bases means adenine guanine thymine cytosine 



single strand of DNA consist of sugar phosphate linkages which are asymmetrical which gives directionality or [[polar]]ity. directionality guides the molecules process by which the information in DNA is both interpreted and copied in cells

how the DNA stores information?

nucleotides are linked by strong [[covalent]] bond and nucleotides on opposite strand are linked by weak [[hydrogen bond]]
