sub atomic particle


1897 cathode ray experiment electron with mass 1000 times smaller then hydrogen atom


1909 Millikan's oil drop experiment determined electron charge


charge   -e = 1.602 177 * 10^-19  C

Mass       m = 9.109 384 * 10^-31 kg




energy corresponding to coulomb law 

(study this after studying integration and differentiation) 22.




in quantum physics electron is a mixture of particle and wave
