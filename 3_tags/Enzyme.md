it was  first described in 1700s

then Eduard Buchner in 1897 which demonstrated the cell free  yeast ferments the alcohol thus proved the molecules that continued to work when removed from the cell 


enzymes are [[protein]] which catalyze or speed up chemical reaction in our body

Frederick W Khune later give the name Enzymes from the Greek word named leavened 

enzyme like other proteins have a molecular weight about 12000 to more than 1 million. 

some require additional chemical group for the activity are called ***co-factor*** either one or more inorganic ions such as $\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ $\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, $\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$, $\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}$ or complex organic or metalorganic molecule called ***co-enzyme*** 

some enzyme requires both co-enzyme and one or more metal ion for activity. a co-enzyme or tthe metal ion that is very tightly or even covalently bound to the enzyme is called prosthetic group


A complete catalytically active enzyme together with its bound coenzyme
