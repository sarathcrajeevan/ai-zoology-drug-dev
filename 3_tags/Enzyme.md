it was  first described in 1700s

then Eduard Buchner in 1897 which demonstrated the cell free  yeast ferments the alcohol thus proved the molecules that continued to work when removed from the cell 


enzymes are [[protein]] which catalyze or speed up chemical reaction in our body

Frederick W Khune later give the name Enzymes from the Greek word named leavened 

enzyme like other proteins have a molecular weight about 12000 to more than 1 million. 

some require additional chemical group for the activity are called ***co-factor*** either one or more inorganic ions such as $\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ $\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, $\mathrm{Mn^{2+}}$, $\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}$ or complex organic or metalorganic molecule called ***co-enzyme*** 

some enzyme requires both co-enzyme and one or more metal ion for activity. a co-enzyme or the metal ion that is very tightly or even covalently bound to the enzyme is called prosthetic group


A complete catalytically active enzyme together with its bound coenzyme and metal ion are called holoenzyme 

protein of such enzyme are called the apoenzyme or apoprotein



### classification

sometimes enzymes have two or more names  to limit ambiguity biochemist worldwide has to adopt a system which divide this into seven class 



| class number | class name      | type of reaction catalized                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | oxidoreductases | transfer of electrons(hydride ion or H ion)                                                                                       |
| 2            | transferase     | Group transfer                                                                                                                    |
| 3            | hydrolases      | Hydrolysis(transfer of functional group to water)                                                                                 |
| 4            | Lysases         | Cleavage of C—C, C—O, C—N, or other bonds by elimination, leaving double<br>bonds or rings, or addition of groups to double bonds |
| 5            | Isomerases      | Transfer of groups within molecules to yield isomeric forms                                                                       |
| 6            | Ligases         | Formation of C—C, C—S, C—O, and C—N bonds by condensation reactions<br>coupled to cleavage of ATP or similar cofactor             |
| 7            | Translocases    | Movement of molecules or ions across membranes or their seperation within membranes                                               |










## How enzyme work


The distinguishing feature of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is that it takes place within the confines of a pocket on the enzyme called the **active site**

The molecule that is bound in the active site and acted upon by the enzyme is called the **substrate**.

There is an energy barrier between S and P To undergo reaction, the molecules must overcome this barrier and therefore must be raised to a higher energy level This is called the **transition state**

The difference between the energy levels of the ground state and the transition state is the **activation energy**
