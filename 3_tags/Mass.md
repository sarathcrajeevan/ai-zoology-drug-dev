| **Newton’s First Law**  | An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force |            |
| **Newton’s Second Law** | The force acting on an object is equal to the mass times its acceleration.            | $$F = ma$$ |
| Newton’s Third Law      | For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.                            |            |



time is independent of mass

mass causes inertia


mass is the fundamental quantity of atoms


$$2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O$$

mass of one atom/ molecule                  2.01 u     16.99 u     18.01 u


1 u = 1 D = 1.660 . 10^-27   kg
