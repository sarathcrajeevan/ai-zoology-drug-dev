| **Newton’s First Law**  | An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force |            |
| **Newton’s Second Law** | The force acting on an object is equal to the mass times its acceleration.            | $$F = ma$$ |
| Newton’s Third Law      | For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.                            |            |



time is independent of mass

mass causes inertia
