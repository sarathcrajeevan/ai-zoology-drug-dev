two type of protein 
 1-fibrous protein
  2-globular

proteins are polymer made up of [[Amino acid]]



### proteins conformation is stabilized largely by weak interactions

folded conformation are called native proteins

stability is the tendency of protein to maintain a native conformation. these are marginally stable

protein with the lowest free energy(most stable) is the protein with the maximum number of weak interactions 

### packing of hydrophobic amino acid away from water favors the protein folding

when the water surrounds the hydrophobic molecules optimal arrangement of molecule result in the highly structured shell or solvation layer

when the non polar groups cluster together the extent of solvation layer decreases and non [[polar]] amino acid tend to concentrate in the interior of the protein


### peptide bond

peptide bond is rigid and planar

peptide conformations are defined by the three dihedral angles also known as torsion angles called $\phi$ (phi),  $\psi$ (psi), and $\omega$ (omega) 



## Secondary structure


a regular secondary structure occurs when the dihedral angle remain the same

few type of secondary structure are stable that is $\alpha$ helix and $\beta$ conformation 

another common type is $\beta$ turn 

secondary structures without a regular pattern are called random coils
