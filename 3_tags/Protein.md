two type of protein 
 1-fibrous protein
  2-globular

proteins are polymer made up of [[Amino acid]]



### proteins conformation is stabilized largely by weak interactions

folded conformation are called native proteins

stability is the tendency of protein to maintain a native conformation. these are marginally stable

protein with the lowest free energy(most stable) is the protein with the maximum number of weak interactions 

### packing of hydrophobic amino acid away from water favors the protein folding

when the water surrounds the hydrophobic molecules optimal arrangement of molecule result in the highly structured shell or solvation layer

when the non polar groups cluster together the extent of solvation layer decreases and non polar amino acid tend to concentrate in the interior of the protein
