1928 Bothe beryllium   bombarded with alpha particle electrically neutral 


1932 Chadwick Recoil experiments with hydrogen and nitrogen  reveled similar mass as proton



$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Charge of neutron, } q_n &= 0\ \text{C} \\
\text{Mass of neutron, } m_n &= 1.6749 \times 10^{-27}\ \text{kg} \\
\text{Spin of neutron, } s_n &= \frac{1}{2}\ \hbar
\end{aligned}$$
