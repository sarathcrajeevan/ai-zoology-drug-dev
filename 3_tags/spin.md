spin is the third quantity beside charge and mass that should be characterize elementary particle in the standard model


observation of spin was first found in the so called stern [[Gerlach experiment]] 

not only silver atoms electrons also have it

spin in mathematics is the quantity that describes the symmetry 

objects looks same after 360 degree rotation

[[electron]]s have a spin of 1/2 this object looks same after 720 degree of rotation

anti electron means positrons have a spin of 1/2

it related to relativity
