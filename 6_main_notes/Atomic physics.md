### what is matter? Is matter continuous or are there elementary particles?


there are elementary particles earlier we considered atoms as elementary particles but now we know atoms are divided into sub atomic particles which are elementary particles





## Dalton's model of atom 


Lomonosov 1756 - law of conservation of mass 

law of definite proportions



| Lomonosov 1756 | law of conservation of mass | Reactant have same mass as products           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Proust 1797    | Law of definite propotions  | mass ratio of constituents is always the same |

combining these two Laws Dalton proposed



| Dalton 1800s | Law of multiple proportions | Ratio of elements in different compounds differ but will always be a multiple of whole number |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |


there are different type of atoms that can form different molecules




further improvement was done by Dobereiner, Newlands, Meyer and finally Mendeleev in  1871


it was grouped into different groups

ordered according to the mass

[[ionizing energy ]] 

[[electron affinity]]


### Plum pudding model 


atom consist of electrons which are negatively charged
overall atoms are charge neutral

1903 Thomas First model with internal structure 

sub atomic structure

internal structure and internal charge separation


### Scattering experiments 


Rutherford 1911 : gold foil experiment


### Rutherford model



Rutherford 1911

positive charge is centered in the nucleus

internal structure - nucleus was discovered 

internal charge and mass separation

cannot explain stability

size of the nucleus is much much smaller than atom


## Quantum description of atoms



### photoelectric effect (revisit the lecture) 34

emission of the electrons start at particular frequency and it is independent of the light

linear function 

Planck constant

light has the quantum like properties

transmitted energy energy of the light comes in portions

independent on intensity but dependent on frequency

light consist of micromagnetic waves and also particles in terms of quanta






### Bohr's model


Electrons orbit the nucleus on discrete orbits. Angular momentum 

different quantized energy level for the electron

internal charge and charge separation

explains peaked emission and absorption spectra

when we shine light to a atom the electron could move to different orbital

cannot be stable

if we accelerate charges it will emit electromagnetic waves 



### Double slit experiment


Young 1801

in this light has wave like properties

light can interfere with each other
