### what is matter? Is matter continuous or are there elementary particles?


there are elementary particles earlier we considered atoms as elementary particles but now we know atoms are divided into sub atomic particles which are elementary particles





## Dalton's model of atom 


Lomonosov 1756 - law of conservation of mass 

law of definite proportions



| Lomonosov 1756 | law of conservation of mass | Reactant have same mass as products           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Proust 1797    | Law of definite propotions  | mass ratio of constituents is always the same |

combining these two Laws Dalton proposed



| Dalton 1800s | Law of multiple proportions | Ratio of elements in different compounds differ but will always be a multiple of whole number |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |


there are different type of atoms that can form different molecules




further improvement was done by Dobereiner, Newlands, Meyer and finally Mendeleev in  1871


it was grouped into different groups

ordered according to the mass

[[ionizing energy ]] 

[[electron affinity]]


### Plum pudding model 


atom consist of electrons which are negatively charged
overall atoms are charge neutral

1903 Thomas First model with internal structure 

sub atomic structure

internal structure and internal charge separation


### Scattering experiments 


Rutherford 1911 : gold foil experiment


### Rutherford model



Rutherford 1911

positive charge is centered in the nucleus

internal structure - nucleus was discovered 

internal charge and mass separation

cannot explain stability
