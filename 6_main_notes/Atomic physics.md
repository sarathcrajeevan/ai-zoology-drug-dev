## Introduction


mass charge and spin 


### what is matter? Is matter continuous or are there elementary particles?


there are elementary particles earlier we considered atoms as elementary particles but now we know atoms are divided into sub atomic particles which are elementary particles





## Dalton's model of atom 


Lomonosov 1756 - law of conservation of mass 

law of definite proportions



| Lomonosov 1756 | law of conservation of mass | Reactant have same mass as products           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Proust 1797    | Law of definite propotions  | mass ratio of constituents is always the same |

combining these two Laws Dalton proposed



| Dalton 1800s | Law of multiple proportions | Ratio of elements in different compounds differ but will always be a multiple of whole number |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |


there are different type of atoms that can form different molecules
