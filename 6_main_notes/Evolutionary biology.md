## Evolution of the SARS-Cov-2

virus jumped from bats from pangolin and raccoon dog then to humans

pangolins raccoon dogs and ant eaters are similar and the example of convergent evolution


when the alpha delta omicron first appeared their genome sequence give a surprise, they had acquired this not by one mutation by  several mutation 

later variants of the virus had combination of mutation in the gene for virus spike protein that is critical for entry into victims cells individually these mutation don't have large effects but combination gives the protein powerful new capabilities these kind of interactions  between  mutations are called epistasis 

hybridization with humans and neanderthalensis
