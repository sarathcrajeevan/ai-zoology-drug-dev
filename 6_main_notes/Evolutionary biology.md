## Evolution of the SARS-Cov-2

virus jumped from bats from pangolin and raccoon dog then to humans

pangolins raccoon dogs and ant eaters are similar and the example of [[convergent evolution]]

when the alpha delta omicron first appeared their genome sequence give a surprise, they had acquired this not by one [[mutation]] by  several mutation 

later variants of the virus had combination of mutation in the gene for virus spike protein that is critical for entry into victims cells individually these mutation don't have large effects but combination gives the protein powerful new capabilities these kind of interactions  between  mutations are called [[epistasis]] 

[[hybridization]] with humans and neanderthalensis 

evolutionary biology extends and amplifies the explanation of biological phenomena it studies proximate causes (immediate ) and ultimate causes (historical)


Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote nothing in the biology makes sense except in the light of evolution


## What is Evolution

evolution derived from the word evolvere which means unfold or unroll 


simply means change 


inherited change in the properties of groups of organisms over the course of generations

Darwin phrased it the evolution is decent with modification

stress of firefly neurodegeneration
