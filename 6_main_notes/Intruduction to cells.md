# Cells and genomes and the diversity of the life 



1
what is life? when we look at the past our ancestor's find something similar in trees , tigers and butterfly without knowing the what [[DNA]] is which is life



the universal feature on life on earth is like waves and candle life needs [[free energy]] to do complex systems and chemical reaction which is specified as hereditary information in the cell





### all cells carry hereditary information in the form of Double strand DNA molecules 


2 
all the cells stores information as in a computer in the form of double stranded molecules of DNA which is composed of long unbranched polymer chains which consist of monomers which are A,T,G,C . we can take a piece of  DNA and successfully read and insert in other organisms like bacterium


### all cells replicate their hereditary information in the by templated polymerization


4
each monomer in a single [[DNA]] strand consist of two parts a sugar with phosphate group    attached to it 

DNA is the information store for hereditary 

templated polymerization is the way in which the information is copied through out the living world 


### All cells transcribe portions of their DNA into RNA molecules

to carry out the information bearing property the DNA must be doing
