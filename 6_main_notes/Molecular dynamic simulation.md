## inter atomic energies


In biological molecules, there can be the [[covalent]] interactions, [[coulomb's interaction]], Van Der Waal's interaction, [[hydrogen bond]]s or electronic interactions.

## steps

### 1.preparation of protein 3D structure


### 2.preparation of protein topology file
The force fields are the mathematical description that we use to model how atoms and molecules interact with each other at the Atomic State.

### 3. solvation and ionization
