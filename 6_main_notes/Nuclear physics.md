in nucleus there are protons and neutrons. they are not sub elementary particle.


in 1917 Rutherford repeated the gold foil experiment with the hydrogen and nitrogen gas. alpha particle emitted from a radioactive substance cause emission of hydrogen nuclei


when we look at the Atomic [[mass]] it is the multiple of hydrogen nucleus

Hydrogen nuclei are considered elementary particles called [[Proton]]s  


### Discovery of [[isotopes]]


Discovery of isotopes had done by two experiment

Soddy 1913 experiments with radioactive decay products

Thomson 1913 : Experiment with neon ions Two distinct spots suggest two different neon atom with different masses
