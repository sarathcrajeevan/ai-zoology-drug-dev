in nucleus there are protons and neutrons. they are not sub elementary particle.


in 1917 Rutherford repeated the gold foil experiment with the hydrogen and nitrogen gas. alpha particle emitted from a radioactive substance cause emission of hydrogen nuclei


when we look at the Atomic [[mass]] it is the multiple of hydrogen nucleus

Hydrogen nuclei are considered elementary particles called [[Proton]]s  


### Discovery of [[isotopes]]


Discovery of isotopes had done by two experiment

Soddy 1913 experiments with radioactive decay products

Thomson 1913 : Experiment with neon ions Two distinct spots suggest two different neon atom with different masses


### this later lead to the discovery of [[neutrons]]



| Isotopes                             | Isobars                          | Isotones                | Isodiaphers | isomer                              | Mirror nuclei                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| same number of protons and electrons | same number of Nucleons and mass | same number of neutrons | N - P       | same number of protons and neutro same number of Nucleons at the same time exchange the neutrons and protons   ime   |


### Stability of Atoms


Decay 

Mass is lost as binding energy


$E = mc^2$

stability of the atom can be determined by average binding energy per nucleon


### Quarks

Protons and neutrons can be further divided which consist of quarks
it can be observed after collision at high energies 
 
(MeV instead of eV)

protons consist of up ,up ,down quark

Neutron consist of up ,down ,down quark


sea of gluons and quark-antiquark pairs

quarks are fermions

four other quarks are observed 



### Strong interaction between nucleons and strong force


strong interaction will only work with the quarks 

strong interaction that holds together quarks will also attract protons and neutrons or protons and protons


Strong force

Nuclear force
