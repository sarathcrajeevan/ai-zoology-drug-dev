## Standard model of elementary particles




we can categorize standard model of elementary particle based on their spin 


| fermions (s=1/2)     | bosons(s=0,1)    |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Matter               | Interactions     |
| quarks               | Gauge bosons     |
| Leptons              | Scalar bosons    |
| Antiparticles exsist | No antiparticles |


### Antiparticle

same [[spin]] and mass
opposite charge



## Quarks


up and down

strange and charm

Top and Bottom


there are quarks and anti quark

mass
