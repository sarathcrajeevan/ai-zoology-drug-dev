## Standard model of elementary particles




we can categorize standard model of elementary particle based on their spin 


| fermions (s=1/2)     | bosons(s=0,1)    |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Matter               | Interactions     |
| quarks               | Gauge bosons     |
| Leptons              | Scalar bosons    |
| Antiparticles exsist | No antiparticles |


### Antiparticle

same [[spin]] and mass
opposite charge

# Fermion:


## Quarks


up and down

strange and charm

Top and Bottom

3 generations of quarks and 6 different type of quarks

up and down are lightest

there are quarks and anti quark

mass 

interaction is carried by gluon

they have fractional charges because they don't exist on their own

Mesons Baryon Antibaryon


## Leptons

there are three generation of leptons

electron  + electron neutrino

muon + muon neutrino

Tau + tau neutrino

electron is much heavier than electron neutrino

electron is lighter

whenever the neutrino is involved they have weak interaction


tau which is generated by cosmic rays and in particle collider



## Bosons

interactions which include gravity electromagnetic interaction strong and weak interaction

Gauge bosons 

photon - 

acts in charge

forms the bound state of particle

interaction particle : photon

more photon is there higher the intensity of the wave

spin of the boson is 1


gluon

strong interaction

8 different type of gluon

interaction particle w and z boson have weak interaction

they have chirality

weak interaction is the only breaks parity symmetry and charge conjugation symmetry
