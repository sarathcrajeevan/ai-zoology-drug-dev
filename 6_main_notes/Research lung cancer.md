Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, less than 7% of patients survive 10Â years following diagnosis across all stages of lung cancer. This is mostly because it's often found too late and there aren't enough effective, personalized treatments. Scientists are using a method called **quantitative proteomics** to study the differences in proteins between healthy people and cancer patients. This helps them understand how lung cancer grows and spreads.

There are several techniques in proteomics, such as **gel-based**, **label-free**, and **isotope labeling**, which help identify key proteins involved in cancer. These methods have helped find proteins that can act as **diagnostic markers**, **predict drug resistance**, and **track disease progression**. By building protein networks, researchers can also better understand how cancer works and find new ways to treat it.
